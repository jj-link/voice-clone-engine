# Voice Clone Engine

A robust, multi-GPU voice cloning system capable of generating high-quality synthetic voices from audio samples.

## Features

- Flexible configuration system
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU(s)
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd voice-cloning-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

ðŸš§ This project is currently under development. The core voice cloning functionality is being actively implemented.

For development status and planned features, see `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

### Running Demos

The project includes a voice embedding visualization demo:
```bash
cd demos
./run_embedding_demo.bat  # On Windows
```

This will generate t-SNE plots and similarity matrices in the `plots` directory.

### GPU Management

ðŸš§ Command-line GPU configuration is coming soon. For now, GPU management is available programmatically:

```python
from src.gpu_manager import GPUManager

with GPUManager() as gpu_manager:
    # Get available GPU information
    gpu_info = gpu_manager.get_gpu_info()
    
    # Select specific GPUs
    devices = gpu_manager.setup_torch_devices([0, 1])  # Use GPUs 0 and 1
    
    # Or let the system select the best GPUs
    best_gpus = gpu_manager.parse_gpu_args("best2")  # Select 2 best GPUs
```

## Output

Generated files will be saved in the following directories:
- `output/`: Generated audio files
- `plots/`: Visualization outputs
- `logs/`: Training and inference logs

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```
